## Play / Quiz
1. The questions and answers are in data/questions.json
2. The images are in data/images/question-images
3. Images aren't showing yet because the quiz structure hasn't been set yet.

## Connect 
1. The connect posts are in data/connect.json
2. The images are in data/images/connect-images

_Update the json files and the images and the app will work with the new content._

## Images
1. Any image that is round needs to be a square image
2. http://imulus.github.io/retinajs/ is used for retina images, e.g. my_image.png and my_image@2x.png, so basically you add @2x to the end of the filename.
3. We need to set a max-width on images so they don't scale beyond there actual size and are not too big. They could be below 1920Ã—1200 in size perhaps, but we need to experiment.
